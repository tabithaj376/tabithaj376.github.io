10 Rules for Arranging Furniture From thespruce.com
When arranging your living room furniture, start with the largest piece first. Consider both size and placement of the various pieces, making sure not to group all the large or small pieces in one area or to one side of the room, which can make space feel lopsided and a little unsettling. The best way to start arranging living room furniture is to choose a focal point for the room, like a fireplace or a set of large windows. The size of your room will always dictate how much space you have, but the idea is that no one has to zig zag too much or get tripped up on furniture as they cross the room.
