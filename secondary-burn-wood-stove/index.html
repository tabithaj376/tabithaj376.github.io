Stallings Sheet Metal May 2011 From stallingssheetmetal.blogspot.com
To understand secondary�s you have to know when they form (1100def f) any wood stove can create secondary flames but its the epa tube stoves that essentially harness the power for clean burn and additional heat. It is sometimes referred to as a clean burn, clean burning stove, or tertiary air, all of which mean a reduction in emissions and an overall improved efficiency. Primary combustion is the burning of the solid fuel, the wood. Secondary burn is a feature incorporated in the majority of new wood burning stoves.

<p>There are some fine catalytic stoves which consumers have been very happy with and visa versa. The chinook is thermostatically controlled and has a long burn time of up 30 hours when it is set on low. Secondary burn design, you can stoke the stove full of wood at night and shut the damper down and get a nice even burn overnight, instead of roasting for hours and then freezing until morning. Secondary burn or combustion on a wood stove is the process of burning off waste gases higher up in the stove in order to produce more heat and to reduce emissions.</p>

<p>Secondary burn design, you can stoke the stove full of wood at night and shut the damper down and get a nice even burn overnight, instead of roasting for hours and then freezing until morning. Primary combustion is the burning of the solid fuel, the wood. The secondary (lower) chamber burn tunnel, contains some brickwork to tunnel ignited gas flow from the exhaust manifold toward the front of the stove and support a secondary combustion then toward the rear of the stove to connect to the chimney manifold at the back of the stove. &quot;DEFRA APPROVED&quot; Coseyfire Petit MultiFuel Woodburning.</p>

Tertiary air is fed into the firebox through the back of the stove to aid with secondary combustion and to further reduce emissions from burning wood. Secondary burn or combustion on a wood stove is the process of burning off waste gases higher up in the stove in order to produce more heat and to reduce emissions.
